# Telegram Message Forwarder Bot

An intelligent and efficient Telegram bot that monitors specific groups, extracts relevant data such as Solana wallet addresses and specific URLs, and forwards them to designated groups or bots. Built for scalability and extensibility, this project ensures accurate filtering, duplicate prevention, and group-specific configurations.

---

## üìã Features
- **Advanced Message Filtering:** Identifies Solana wallet addresses and specific URLs (e.g., `pump.fun`, `dexscreener.com`).
- **Targeted Forwarding:** Filters and forwards messages based on group IDs and user IDs.
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Maintains a tracking system to prevent redundant forwarding.
- **Customizable Group Notifiers:** Adds a tailored notifier to forwarded messages for better context.
- **Automated Cleanup:** Periodically clears outdated tracking data for optimal performance.
- **Resilient Architecture:** Handles errors gracefully and ensures smooth operation with continuous monitoring.

## üîß Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.8 or later** installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install telethon
3. Obtain the following credentials from the [Telegram Developer Portal](https://my.telegram.org/)):
    api_id
    api_hash

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/kensdv/tg-automation
cd tg-automation
2. Create config.json
Create a config.json file in the root directory with the following structure:

json
Copy code
{
  "api_id": "<YOUR_API_ID>",
  "api_hash": "<YOUR_API_HASH>",
  "group_notifiers": {
    "<GROUP_ID_1>": "<NOTIFIER_KEY_1>",
    "<GROUP_ID_2>": "<NOTIFIER_KEY_2>"
  },
  "notifier_keys": {
    "<NOTIFIER_KEY_1>": "<CUSTOM_NOTIFIER_TEXT_1>",
    "<NOTIFIER_KEY_2>": "<CUSTOM_NOTIFIER_TEXT_2>"
  },
  "destination_group_id": "<DESTINATION_GROUP_ID>",
  "trading_bot_id": "<TRADING_BOT_ID>",
  "specified_group_id": "<SPECIFIED_GROUP_ID>",
  "specified_user_id": "<SPECIFIED_USER_ID>"
}
3. User Inputs Required
API Credentials:
<YOUR_API_ID>: Your Telegram API ID.
<YOUR_API_HASH>: Your Telegram API hash.
Group-Specific Inputs:
<GROUP_ID_X>: Telegram group IDs to monitor.
<NOTIFIER_KEY_X>: Keys defining the custom notifier text for specific groups.
Forwarding Targets:
<DESTINATION_GROUP_ID>: The group ID where messages will be forwarded.
<TRADING_BOT_ID>: The bot ID for trading-related forwards.
Filters:
<SPECIFIED_GROUP_ID>: The group where messages from a specific user will be filtered.
<SPECIFIED_USER_ID>: The Telegram user ID to monitor in the specified group.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Bot
After completing the setup, start the bot with:

bash
Copy code
python bot.py


 üîç How It Works
Message Monitoring:

The bot listens to messages from the configured groups.
Filters messages by:
Solana wallet address format (32‚Äì44 alphanumeric characters).
URLs matching pump.fun or dexscreener.com.
Content Filtering:

Filters out duplicate wallet addresses already forwarded.
Applies user-specific filtering within a designated group.
Message Forwarding:

Constructs a forwarding message containing:
Detected wallet addresses.
Matching URLs.
A group-specific notifier.
Forwards the message to:
A destination group.
A trading bot.
Duplicate Prevention:

Tracks forwarded content using a timestamped dictionary.
Automatically clears old entries every 24 hours.

## üí° Example Workflow
A monitored group sends a message:
kotlin
Copy code
Check out this token: https://pump.fun/token123
Wallet: E7dhJ2NCjf82HqYzLFGfFhYh6zMzT7uL5Dg7ZZpJ
The bot detects:
Solana address: E7dhJ2NCjf82HqYzLFGfFhYh6zMzT7uL5Dg7ZZpJ
URL: https://pump.fun/token123
Constructs a message:
arduino
Copy code
üö® Risky Gamble üü™

E7dhJ2NCjf82HqYzLFGfFhYh6zMzT7uL5Dg7ZZpJ
https://pump.fun/token123
Forwards the message to:
A destination group.
A trading bot.
